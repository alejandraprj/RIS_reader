AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is one of the major crises in the valparai region of Anamalai Tiger Reserves (ATR). It is essential to reduce the HWC to save people from the wildlife and also to protect wildlife. In this paper, we propose an automated unsupervised system for the identification and classification of animals from their acoustic signal. The environment sound signals are captured using a microphone and the audio is stored in a.wav file and is sent to a base station through a radio frequency (RF) network. This system is processed with three steps (i) from the received audio signal initially, animal identification is done by extracting features of an animal signal using Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and classification of animal is performed by radial basis function (RBF) neural network, (ii) age estimation (calf/adult) is performed by autocorrelation, (iii) elephant state of mind (SOM) is detected by extracting features of an elephant acoustic signal using gammatone frequency cepstral coefficient (GFCC) and classification of various sounds of elephant are performed by support vector machine (SVM). Based on this, an early warning message which contains an animal type, age (calf/adult), elephant SOM, global positioning system (GPS) tracks its location information and all this information will be transmitted via global system for mobile communication (GSM) to the forest authorities, local communities, radio station or local channels indicating that an animal movement is near to forest border areas. The results were fed into a separate web page using the internet of thing (IoT).

AB  - With the widespread use of the Internet of Things (IoT), use cases in IoT have been considered for solving social problems in various fields such as agriculture, welfare, disaster prevention, and transportation infrastructure. Additionally, crop damage caused by animals is a common occurrence all over the world. An example of such damage is the damage to agricultural crops and threat to elderly people owing to animals in Hakusan city, Ishikawa prefecture, where the Hakusan campus of the authors' university is located. Presently, measures against damage caused by animals are being implemented by installing animal traps and cages; however, it is necessary to patrol the conditions of capture, thereby increasing human effort. To solve this problem, the authors considered a wildlife monitoring system to remotely manage a cage by using a sensor or camera with Internet connectivity. Assuming that a large number of IoT devices would be used in such a system, the authors visualize a high network load problem. Therefore, the authors aim to reduce the load on the IoT network. In this paper, the part of the wildlife-monitoring system that is concerned the evaluation and consideration of network using MQTT is described.

AB  - Maintaining biodiversity is a key component of the United Nations (UN) "Life on Land" sustainability goal. Remote camera traps monitoring animals' movements support research in biodiversity. However, images from these camera traps are currently labeled manually resulting in high processing costs and long delays. This paper proposes an IoT-based system that leverages deep learning and edge computing to automatically label camera trap images and transmit this information to scientists in a timely manner. Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121 were trained on data consisting of 33,984 images taken during day and night with 6 animal classes. Inception-V3 yielded the highest macro average Fl-score of 0.93 and an accuracy of 94%. An IoT-based system was developed that directly captures images from a commercial camera trap, does the inference on the edge using a Raspberry Pi (RPi), and sends the classification results back to a cloud database system. A mobile App is used to monitor the camera images classified on camera traps in real-time. The RPi could easily sustain a rate of processing 1 image every 2 seconds with an average latency of 1.8 second/image. After capture and pre-processing, each inference took an average of 0.2 Millisecond/image on a RPi Model 4B.

AB  - Forests, one of the most valuable and necessary resources and protect earth's ecological balance, are a natural habitat to animals and forest products are vital in our lives in many direct and indirect ways. But wildfires can cause critical damage to grounds and many other resources like properties, human life, wildlife in superabundant amounts. Wildfires burn acres of land and destroy everything in their paths in mere minutes. Wildfire destroys homes, animals, trees and plants, wildlife as well as vegetation. The effects of wildfires are numerous and wide-ranging. it causes a hugely significant impact on the economy, environment, heritage and social fabric of rural areas. Naturally caused wildfires can be predicted using factors[3] like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pressure and many more. In this paper, the prediction of forest fires by machine learning using some operational monitoring over a region and encountering changes in climate using different sensors are advocated. The Wildfire Prediction System (WiPreSy) monitors and records changes in climatic parameters and predicts the intensity of forest fire based on real-time data, thus avoiding the massive loss due to forest fires.

AB  - In this paper we propose a new dual radio IoT network architecture for wildlife monitoring system (WMS). WMS leverages bluetooth low energy (BLE) in low power wide area networks (LPWANs) by dynamically changing the operating radio based on the proximity among herd of wild animals. This approach will facilitate ultra-low power IoT devices to be deployed for sustainable wildlife monitoring application. In addition we present an analytical model to investigate the performance of the proposed IoT network in terms of energy consumption under a wildlife monitoring use-case. The simulation results show that the dual radio network leads to a higher energy efficiency when compared to the network utilizing only LPWAN. Moreover, our network readily doubles the network life time for various data traffic rates.

AB  - With the increasing use of the Internet of things (IoT), heterogeneous IoT services are offered to satisfy various needs. The Fed4IoT project aims to develop an IoT virtualization technology to realize a smart-city application that federates heterogeneous IoT services. In this project, wildlife monitoring was chosen as an example of the application. Wildlife damage is not only an agricultural problem but also is disturbing the daily lives of people who live in rural areas. It has been a universal problem for a long time. In this use case, an IoT platform with end devices that consist of a cage, camera, target counter, etc. is employed, and local offices and residents are informed of an animal's approach, the condition of the cage, etc. through an information-centric network. The obtained data are used in other Fed4IoT services. In this work, the IoT platform and its application to wildlife monitoring are discussed. Moreover, this study and the project aim to help in the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (c) (17 goals and 169 targets to eradicate poverty and realize a sustainable world).

AB  - In this paper, we introduce dual radio based IoT network architecture for wildlife monitoring system (WMS). This solution will facilitate an IoT devices to be deployed for sustainable wildlife monitoring applications. In addition we present MANER, a managed data dissemination scheme for WMS. In MANER, data forwarding is optimized with a replication function to control and prioritize data dissemination. In WMS scenario wild animals show a sparsely con-specific mobility, which often results in a sporadic wireless link among nodes. Unlike existing opportunistic algorithms, MANER optimally makes forwarding decisions by leveraging locally available information. Hence, the proposed algorithm adopts to dynamic network topology due to the inherent intermittent connectivity among mobile herd of animals. We evaluated the performance of MANER by considering standard and real-life mobility models. Experimental results indicated that MANER decreases the average latency by up-to 65%, when compared to benchmark opportunistic algorithms. In addition MANER readily increased the network delivery ratio for various data traffic rates.

AB  - The global environment has been worsening, and governments around the world have realized that the establishment of natural protected areas is one of the important ways to achieve sustainable development. Natural protected areas are spatial carriers for protecting biodiversity, natural resources and cultural heritages, and play a vital role in achieving regional ecological security. Combined with the evolution rules of the complex ecosystem, this article establishes the protection framework and optimizes the protection strategies of natural protected areas with landsenses ecology as the main theoretical basis. Taking Dalinor National Nature Reserve as an example, protection strategies are analyzed from three aspects, namely protection objectives, protection contents and protection measures. Based on the three-zone management model of natural protected areas, the Internet of Things (IoT) is used to help managers better understand various data indicators of the residents, resources and rare species in natural protected areas; mix-marching data platform is used to conduct data analysis and quantitative evaluation. By doing so, protection strategies can be carried out through a process of melioration.

AB  - Wildlife extinction has becomes the subject of attention recently due to decreasing statistical population number reported by the wildlife conservation organizations. Deforestation is one of the issues surrounding the loss of animal species in the wild. Malaysia had the world's highest rate of forest loss between 2000 and 2012, according to a new global forest map developed in partnership with Google Inc. In respond to this, a certain measure of control needs to be implemented to avoid further losses of forest and animal species from the wild. This paper describes the hardware development on real time monitoring and tracking system for Malaysian forest with the Internet of Things (IoT) implementation. The system comprises among others, the IR camera, GPS module, wireless XBEE module, Nano microcontroller and PIR sensor. The Cluster Tree network topology is formed with XBEE wireless module, to enable for data transmission over the long range and cover the unreachable network area. Thus, this paper will describe the hardware development of wireless sensor devices for Malaysian forest monitoring and tracking activities.

AB  - One serious problem that all the developing nations are facing today is injuries and death of animals due to road accidents. Report says that, there are around 300,000 collisions per year. However, many of the databases exclude accidents that have vehicle damage less than $1,000 (https://apiar.org.au/wpcontent/uploads/2017/07/23_APJCECT_ICT-268-281.Pdf, [1]). Accidents lead to the reduction in wildlife. Eventually, this may lead to reduction and endangered of rare species. A system has to be designed to overcome this problem. In this paper, the problem is addressed by focusing on designing an IoT-based system which will perform two functions one is alerting the driver whenever an animal is nearer to the vehicle and the second one is alerting the driver whenever he exceeds the speed limit, especially in the forest region.

AB  - Monitoring wild animals in their natural habitat and in real time constitutes an essential aspect of biological and environmental studies. Monitoring is mainly conducted through wireless wildlife monitoring systems (WMS) due to their energy efficiency and scalability properties. However, using WMS often involves the deployment of energy demanding wireless radio technologies and protocols that significantly increase energy consumption while tracking mobile animals. Thanks to the raise of IoT devices capable of sensing, computing, and wireless networking, WMS can become more efficient and overcome the initial drawbacks. This paper, describes an activity driven beaconing mechanism based on unsupervised activity classification scheme. The algorithm is evaluated for different parameters involving the sampling rate, processing window as well as different cluster sizes. The evaluation shows that use of lightweight algorithms and low sampling rates provides the possibility to reliably monitor the activity of the animal. The evaluation results showed that the proposed mechanism could reduce energy consumption by increasing communication sleep-time while the objects were stationary.

AB  - Biologists have long struggled to monitor the behavior of wild animals, though remote sensing technologies have allowed recent insights into otherwise cryptic animal behaviors. Traditional methods of animal tracking use radio- or GPS-transmitters that are expensive, large, and unable to track animal movements on a fine-scale. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology poses a cheap and unobtrusive solution to track activity of animals near antenna stations, though current data loggers face problems with energy supply, data format, and data access/storage. Internet of Things (IoT) holds promise as a tool to advance this type of zoological research through its integration of embedded systems, sensors, control systems and wireless communications. In this project we propose the structure of a system that combines RFID and IoT technologies to enable real-time tracking of feeder usage by wild birds in central Arkansas. The proposed system will replace existing data loggers and provide continuous, automated, and real-time data collection with minimal personnel oversight. The design will be superior to more expensive commercially-available units and will represent a breakthrough in wildlife monitoring technology.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is an important challenge to communities living in areas bordering wildlife game parks and reserves. It is more evident in the United Republic of Tanzania, whose economy depends on wildlife tourism. This paper proposes a low-cost and low-power early warning system using the Internet of Things (IoT) and Short Message Service (SMS) to support HWC respond teams in mitigating these challenges. The system comprises three primary units: sensing, processing, and alerting. The sensing unit consists of a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor, a Global Positioning System (GPS), and a Raspberry Pi camera. The PIR sensor detects the proximity of the animal using the heat signature, GPS senses and records the current location, while the Raspberry Pi camera has the primary purpose of taking a picture after the PIR sensor detects the proximity of the animal. The processing unit with a Raspberry microcomputer performs data processing and image inferencing using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm. Last is the alerting unit, which includes a Global System for Mobile (GSM) communications module for sending SMS messages to the human-wildlife conflict response team and the nearer community response team leader whenever wild animals are spotted near the park's border. The system detects, identifies, and reports the detected wild animals. The GPRS provides internet connectivity to support data collection, storage, and monitoring in the cloud.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that is changing our world by making it a smarter and a better place to live in. The idea to build a smart and connected world cannot be imagined without the IoT. Many modern houses and buildings are equipped with different sensors, which are constantly monitoring specific parameters and are reporting them to the owners or to the residents. However, we are not the only inhabitants of this planet and as dominant species, we have the obligation to take care and look after the wildlife and the natural resources of Earth. According to a recent study, which was carried out by the National Center for Scientific Research of France (CNRS), the population of farmland birds has rapidly decreased by more than 30% in the last 17 years. This trend is presenting a significant problem for the bird populations, the ecosystems and the biodiversity as whole. Finding nutrition and water is quite daunting task for some bird species, especially during cold weather or in the winter. This is one of the many situations, where the IoT technology can be utilized. With the help of the modern information and communication technologies, we are planning to build smart cloud connected birdhouses, which could help protect the endangered bird species.

AB  - The boreal forest ecosystem of Alberta is increasingly affected by the human development related to natural-resource extraction, pipelines, roads and seismic lines. To evaluate the efficiency of restoration treatments, this project aims at the monitoring of physical conditions and human/wildlife presence on a recovered seismic lines ecosystem. For monitoring human and animal uses of industrial linear features, an Internet of Things (IoT) prototype system is developed with open source hardware, and open interoperable IoT standard. We try to build an accurate and cost-effective tool to detect the impact of human footprint and monitor the habit of the wild animal. So we implemented four types of trail counter which is a low-cost, open-source measurement device that counts pedestrian, bikes, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), cars, and animals on trails, paths, and sidewalks.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce an asynchronous dual interface opportunistic beacon network for wildlife monitoring. Unlike conventional opportunistic networks which are based on multi-copy data replication techniques, our approach utilizes an optimized single-copy beacon data transmission to achieve high energy efficiency. Furthermore, the collected data is aggregated and relayed to the central system by leveraging a low power and long range radio to provide high connectivity coverage. This approach will allow ultra-low power IoT devices to be deployed for sustainable wildlife monitoring applications. We evaluate the proposed approach in an actual animal movement use-case scenario. The results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional opportunistic network protocols in-terms of energy consumption and packet delivery ratio.

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are the basis for wildlife monitoring systems (WMS) because of their flexibility and energy-efficiency. However, their utilization often involves an inherently frequent data advertising mechanism that can result in a significantly higher energy consumption for monitoring mobile animals. To overcome this issue, we propose an mobility event-driven beacon advertising control scheme based on an unsupervised algorithm. We transmit more frequently in a panic state and less frequently during passive state. We compared our approach with a conventional periodic advertising and K-Mean clustering based schemes by analyzing the network energy consumption. The results show that the proposed mechanism could indeed reduce the energy consumption substantially by adaptively adjusting the node wake-up time to specific animal movement states.

AB  - Aim Our current understanding of the causes of global extinction risk is mostly informed by the expert knowledge-based "threats classification scheme" of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Studies based on this dataset came to different conclusions about the relative importance of threats to species, depending on which taxonomic groups and levels of extinction risk were considered, and which version of the database was used. A key reason may lie in data limitations as causes of threat are well known for charismatic and well-studied species, but not for the majority of species assessed. Here, we aim to fill current knowledge gaps about the importance of drivers of global extinction risks by focusing on endemic species. Location Global. Methods We examined country-level variation in the proportion of globally threatened and extinct endemic species (Index of Threat, IoT) with a range of spatially explicit information about anthropogenic pressures, mitigation measures and data limitations. Results IoT coincided with several anthropogenic pressures, with substantial differences among kingdoms, life-forms, levels of extinction risk and geographic locations. IoT of plants, particularly tropical woody plants of moderate extinction risk, was higher in countries with higher GDP and more invasive species. Furthermore, IoT of animals, particularly tropical mammals and invertebrates of moderate extinction risk, was higher in countries with higher GDP and smaller roadless areas. Main conclusions The extinction crisis for endemic species is associated with a complex network of potential drivers that need to be considered in concert in conservation policy and practice. Although our results require careful interpretation and remain sensitive to data limitations, we encourage similar studies at smaller scales to identify potential drivers of extinction risk at a higher resolution, particularly in regions where species assessments have been conducted consistently or on organisms with a uniform response time to pressures.

AB  - Smart agriculture and wildlife monitoring are one of the recent trends of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, which are evolving in providing sustainable solutions from producers. This article details the design, development and assessment of a wildlife monitoring application for IoT animal repelling devices that is able to cover large areas, thanks to the low power wide area networks (LPWAN), which bridge the gap between cellular technologies and short range wireless technologies. LoRa, the global de-facto LPWAN, continues to attract attention given its open specification and ready availability of off-the-shelf hardware, with claims of several kilometers of range in harsh challenging environments. At first, this article presents a survey of the LPWAN for smart agriculture applications. We proceed to evaluate the performance of LoRa transmission technology operating in the 433 MHz and 868 MHz bands, aimed at wildlife monitoring in a forest vegetation area. To characterize the communication link, we mainly use the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and packet delivery ratio (PDR). Findings from this study show that achievable performance can greatly vary between the 433 MHz and 868 MHz bands, and prompt caution is required when taking numbers at face value, as this can have implications for IoT applications. In addition, our results show that the link reaches up to 860 m in the highly dense forest vegetation environment, while in the not so dense forest vegetation environment, it reaches up to 2050 m.

AB  - Forests are an enduring component of the natural world and perform a vital role in protecting the environment. Forests are valuable resources to control global warming and provide oxygen for the survival of human life, including wood for households. Forest fires have recently emerged as a major threat to biological processes and the ecosystem. Unfortunately, almost every year, fire damages millions of hectares of forest land due to late and inefficient detection of fire. However, it is important to identify the forest fire at the initial level before it spreads to vast areas and destroys natural resources. In this paper, a formal model of the Internet of Things (IoT) and drone-based forest fire detection and counteraction system is presented. The proposed system comprises network maintenance. Sensor deployment is on trees, the ground, and animals in the form of subnets to transmit sensed data to the control room. All subnets are connected to the control room through gateway nodes. Alarms are being used to alert human beings and animals to save their lives, which will help to initially protect them from fire. The embedded sensors collect the information and transfer it to the gateways. Drones are being used for real-time visualization of fire-affected areas and to perform actions to control fires because they play a vital role in disasters. Graph theory is used to construct an efficient model and to show the connectivity of the network. To identify failures and develop recovery procedures, the algorithm is designed through the graph-based model. The model is developed by the Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL), and the correctness of the model is ensured using various VDM-SL toolbox facilities.

AB  - Energy-neutral operation (ENO) is a major concern for Internet of things (IoT) sensor systems. Animals can be tagged with IoT sensors to monitor their movement and behavior. These sensors wirelessly upload collected data and can receive parameters to change their operation. Typically, the behavior monitors are powered by a battery where the system relies upon harvesting solar radiation for sustainable operation. Solar panels typically are used as the harvesting mechanism and can have a level of uncertainty regarding consistent energy delivery due to factors such as adverse weather, foliage, time of day, and individual animal behavior. The variability of available energy inevitably creates a trade-off in the rate at which data can be collected with respect to incoming and stored energy. The objective of this research was to investigate and simulate methods and parameters that can control the data collection rate of an IoT behavior monitor to achieve sustained operation with unknown and random energy harvesting. Analysis and development of a control system were performed by creating a software model of energy consumption and then simulating using different initial conditions and random energy harvesting rates for evaluation. The contribution of this effort was the exploration into the usage of a discrete-time gain scheduled Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) that was tuned to a specific device configuration, using battery state of charge as an input, and found to maintain a battery level set-point, reject small solar harvesting energy disturbances, and maintain a consistent data collection rate throughout the day.

AB  - In our country every years, vermin causes a big economic harm. Hidden and normal herd of vermin attacks plants and field gradually but it causes huge harm in agriculture area and snakes like dangerous animal harms the farmers and local community too. However, these vermin and animal can't be recognized in their curable stage and farmer could usage the pesticides and insecticides without knowing it. Then this could reduce the efficient state. So the paper presents here, we use the design of an Automated Ultrasonic-insects and animal repeller that constitute of an ultrasonic sensor, an motion-sensor, a GSM module and Arduino Uno board.This detect the sound of vermin by noticing ultrasonic signals propagated by provisioning event of vermin in crops. Then the presence of vermin proved by the motion sensor. Once presence of vermin confirmed by both the sensors Arduino Uno board start ultrasonic repeller by which the animal or insect goes away from that area and a memorandum will be sent by using GSM module and then farmer get ready for protecting it and they can use pesticides or insecticides according to their crops.

AB  - A long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) targets both mobile and static Internet of Things (IoT) applications; it is suited to IoT applications, which require a large coverage area while consuming less power at a low data rate; it provides a solution for transferring data between IoT devices with a minimum cost in terms of power, at the expense of higher latency. LoRaWAN was designed for static low-power long-range networks. However, several IoT solution applications involve the use of mobility. Therefore, this study investigates the usage of LoRaWAN in the field of mobile Internet of Things applications such as bike rentals, fleet monitoring, and wildlife and animal tracking applications. Using the OMNeT++ simulator, two different well-known mobility models are used to investigate the influence of mobility on the performance of mobile LoRaWAN. The results show that intense LoRaWAN networks can operate under a high velocity and varying traffic load. It can be observed that the random waypoint model combination yields a better performance, but at the cost of higher collisions and energy consumption. As a consequence, the results suggest the reconsideration of mobile IoT solutions over LoRaWAN.

AB  - The zoo is a local facility where some wild or exotic animals are placed in a fence. The main significance of the zoo is to provide educational and animal conservation functions, and secondly to provide public viewing and entertainment. Animal care and management in the zoo is almost open all year round. Its basic tasks include accommodation, breeding, health care, and medical care etc. Because there are nearly hundreds, thousands, or even ten thousands animals with different body shape and characteristics in the zoo that need to be cared for and managed, animal administrators must be skilled in various tools and real time control the condition of all animals, resulting in the heavy workload of the animal administrators and the huge operating expenses of the zoo. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to reduce the workload of the animal administrators, but also to immediately control the current state of the animals, while saving animal care and management expenses. This study proposes a development architecture for the intelligent animal management system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). Its main purpose is to automate some tedious procedures for caring animals through the IoT and AI to help animal administrators to take care of them and manage them more systematically.

AB  - The ever-improving Internet of things (IoT) and computer vision technologies have enabled automated monitoring of animals, which is essential for understanding animal behavior and conservation of ecosystem. The tradeoff between survey cost and sampling variability is a significant issue in designing a camera survey considering the risk of losing informative images; the monitoring accuracy tends to decrease in accordance with data reduction. However, there has been no designing method for time-lapse realtime monitoring over networks to guarantee monitoring accuracy. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Realtime Animal Monitoring over Network (RAMNe). The goal of RAMNe is to efficiently detect target animals in realtime using network cameras. We propose a determination method for the monitoring interval to guarantee the target value of monitoring accuracy based on a formal theoretical analysis using the Age of Information (AoI). The proposed scheme can minimize the amount of transferred data to enable efficient and stable monitoring even in resource-limited environments. The performance of RAMNe was evaluated with ns-3 simulations to confirm the relationship between monitoring accuracy and interval.

AB  - In places with high population and human mobility, intrusion of wildlife is lethal for humans as well as the animals. Due to the diverse nature of movement and physical sizes of wild animals, it is a challenging talk to track these animals or perform surveillance. As a solution to this issue, this paper proposes a system that can help in identification of intrusion of wild animals at agricultural farms by means of Internet of things and a Wi-Fi based wireless microcontroller unit. Prototyping is performed using Energia IDE for transmission of information to the forest officer from the transmitter node. Pillars consisting of an electronic unit with buzzer, vibration sensor, laser detector, laser diode, RF transceiver and ultra low power microcontrollers are placed at the corners of the field. On infringement, an alert message is transmitted by the Wi-Fi module. An animal database is used for testing of the proposed system. The forest officer is alerted by means of a Python server. Prevention of casualties in areas where there is a higher rate of interaction between humans and wild animals is enabled through this system.

AB  - Camera traps deployed in remote locations provide an effective method for ecologists to monitor and study wildlife in a non-invasive way. However, current camera traps suffer from two problems. First, the images are manually classified and counted, which is expensive. Second, due to manual coding, the results are often stale by the time they get to the ecologists. Using the Internet of Things (IoT) combined with deep learning represents a good solution for both these problems, as the images can be classified automatically, and the results immediately made available to ecologists. This paper proposes an IoT architecture that uses deep learning on edge devices to convey animal classification results to a mobile app using the LoRaWAN low-power, wide-area network. The primary goal of the proposed approach is to reduce the cost of the wildlife monitoring process for ecologists, and to provide real-time animal sightings data from the camera traps in the field. Camera trap image data consisting of 66,400 images were used to train the InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNetB1, DenseNet121, and Xception neural network models. While performance of the trained models was statistically different (Kruskal-Wallis: Accuracy H(5) = 22.34, p < 0.05; F1-score H(5) = 13.82, p = 0.0168), there was only a 3% difference in the F1-score between the worst (MobileNet V2) and the best model (Xception). Moreover, the models made similar errors (Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) > 0.88 and Adjusted Mutual Information (AMU) > 0.82). Subsequently, the best model, Xception (Accuracy = 96.1%; F1-score = 0.87; F1-Score = 0.97 with oversampling), was optimized and deployed on the Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, and Nvidia Jetson edge devices using both TenorFlow Lite and TensorRT frameworks. Optimizing the models to run on edge devices reduced the average macro F1-Score to 0.7, and adversely affected the minority classes, reducing their F1-score to as low as 0.18. Upon stress testing, by processing 1000 images consecutively, Jetson Nano, running a TensorRT model, outperformed others with a latency of 0.276 s/image (s.d. = 0.002) while consuming an average current of 1665.21 mA. Raspberry Pi consumed the least average current (838.99 mA) with a ten times worse latency of 2.83 s/image (s.d. = 0.036). Nano was the only reasonable option as an edge device because it could capture most animals whose maximum speeds were below 80 km/h, including goats, lions, ostriches, etc. While the proposed architecture is viable, unbalanced data remain a challenge and the results can potentially be improved by using object detection to reduce imbalances and by exploring semi-supervised learning.

AB  - As a promising use-case of the Internet of Things (IoT), wildlife tracking and monitoring applications greatly benefit the ecology-related research both commercially and scientifically. In literature, a forward-wait-deliver strategy has been researched to facilitate energy-efficient dissemination of delay-tolerant information, which penitentially contributes to long-term tracking and monitoring. However, this strategy is not directly applicable for wildlife tracking and monitoring applications, as the movement trajectory of animals cannot be precisely predicted for relay selection. To this end, further studies are required to utilize partially predictable mobility based on more generalized navigational information such as the movement direction. In this paper, the feasible exploitation of directional movement in path-unconstrained mobility is investigated for strategic forwarding. Our proposal is an advance to the state-of-the-art because the directional correlation of destination movement is considered to dynamically exploit the node mobility for the optimal selection of a stationary relay. Simulation results show that higher delivery utility can be achieved by the proposed fuzzy path model compared with a forwarding scheme without contact prediction or one based on linear trajectory model.

AB  - Ambient levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF) have risen sharply in the last 80 years, creating a novel energetic exposure that previously did not exist. Most recent decades have seen exponential increases in nearly all environments, including rural/remote areas and lower atmospheric regions. Because of unique physiologies, some species of flora and fauna are sensitive to exogenous EMF in ways that may surpass human reactivity. There is limited, but comprehensive, baseline data in the U.S. from the 1980s against which to compare significant new surveys from different countries. This now provides broader and more precise data on potential transient and chronic exposures to wildlife and habitats. Biological effects have been seen broadly across all taxa and frequencies at vanishingly low intensities comparable to today's ambient exposures. Broad wildlife effects have been seen on orientation and migration, food finding, reproduction, mating, nest and den building, territorial maintenance and defense, and longevity and survivorship. Cyto- and geno-toxic effects have been observed. The above issues are explored in three consecutive parts: Part 1 questions today's ambient EMF capabilities to adversely affect wildlife, with more urgency regarding 5G technologies. Part 2 explores natural and man-made fields, animal magnetoreception mechanisms, and pertinent studies to all wildlife kingdoms. Part 3 examines current exposure standards, applicable laws, and future directions. It is time to recognize ambient EMF as a novel form of pollution and develop rules at regulatory agencies that designate air as 'habitat' so EMF can be regulated like other pollutants. Wildlife loss is often unseen and undocumented until tipping points are reached. Long-term chronic low-level EMF exposure standards, which do not now exist, should be set accordingly for wildlife, and environmental laws should be strictly enforced.

AB  - Surveillance system applications are drastically growing from small buildings to a wide area of forest monitoring. Forests provide various important things to our daily lives like oxygen, honey. Living things like animals and birds are living in forests. Thus, it is essential to monitor and protect the forests and their assets. To do that, smart sensors have been deployed in the forest to monitor and record the environmental impacts. The abnormal events are identified and detected using the appropriate IOT devices to reduce the risk. Also, to improve the accuracy, the sensed data is analyzed, processed using a software module. Various existing approaches used for learning the data and object detection was good, but slow in the process, which fails in reducing risks. To overcome these issues, this paper utilizes one of the Deep Learning Algorithms such as the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for Forest Monitoring and identifying the abnormality. The deep CNN has experimented with MATLAB software and the results are verified. The performance of deep CNN is evaluated by comparing the obtained results with the existing approaches and found that deep CNN outperforms the others.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects embedded with software, electronics, sensors and network connectivity which enables these objects to collect and exchange data. IoT based image processing is reaching up to a different level which is becoming a major part of everyone life. IoT based image segmentation is used to solve the real world problems like animal classification in wildlife monitoring and vehicle classification etc. Image segmentation is one of the processes of image processing technique which involves partitioning an image into multiple segments so that any region of interest can be obtained easily. The modified graph cut approach is one of the image segmentation techniques that avoid the boundary and region balance problem of graph cut technique by removing the regional term and strengthening the boundary term with the prior information. By combining shape priors in an adaptive way, a robust way to harness the shape prior was introduced in graphcut segmentation that reduced the memory size required for modified graph cut implementation. However, the structural regularities were not handled by the modified graph cut with adaptive shape prior method. Hence, in this proposed work the structural irregularities in image shapes are considered for image segmentation where the connectivity constraints are formulated such that corresponding optimization problems are all NP-hard which is solved by optimized DijkstraGC and problem decomposition approach. The segmentation with satisfied constraint results in an efficient image segmentation which reduces amount of time required for segmentation process. Furthermore, parameter of adaptive shape prior and connectivity constraints are optimized using BAT algorithm to improve the performance of image segmentation. Results clearly shows that proposed approach gives better results in terms of Root Mean Square, Energy Consumption and correlation coefficient. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This work presents the design and development of a cloud based system prototype for monitoring birds in the wild, following the Internet of Things paradigm principles and tendencies. The behavior and population of birds represent an important metric to measure the health of an ecosystem, becoming a very important tool to study the climate change influence on the environment. The system is built using NodeJs for the backend and a Cloud Computing Platform as a Service technology is utilized for the deployment to enhance the accessibility and scalability, while reducing operation and deployment costs. For this project, it is assumed the challenge of deploying the prototype without any monetary investment. The research main purpose is to set a real time bird nest monitoring web system, for environment and animal behavior data collection and analysis, designed to define a communication standard for the integration from custom made devices utilized to collect the data, allowing for a better integration of different contraptions built to obtain wildlife data with minimum interference and giving enough dynamism with stateless communication protocols to handle new data types from a wide variety of sensors. The standardization and centralization aims to solve the current issue of remotely collecting data from monitoring devices and the ability to share raw data among wildlife researchers, offering worldwide availability through a web portal for the users to access the collected data.

AB  - Agriculture faces a large volume of issues in the future that include climate change, growing population, and resource allocation. In addition, soil macronutrients tracking along with land management has always been a challenging field. Since, the macronutrients combined with soil pH, soil moisture, light intensity, air temperature and humidity steers the crop growth, it is imperative to track and log these data points to provide optimal crop growth conditions. In the past, there has been a lack of devices that could track soil conditions for a farmer resulting in non-optimal crop growth. In this paper we propose the Field Agronomic Condition Testing (F.A.C.T) that aids the farmers to test and log soil conditions. F.A.C.T combines agriculture and computer science under the umbrella of IoT (Internet of Things) in order to collect environmental data for agricultural or conservation land improvement across the globe. This device was developed using Raspberry Pi 3, a credit card sized computer, Elegoo Uno microcontrollers, and multiple sensors that collect data on light intensity, soil Ph, soil moisture, air temperature, and humidity. No device exists that can take these readings and present the data in this fashion. Data collection is initiated by either hard buttons on the device or by applications on Raspberry Pi that may be accessed by any device that can connect to the VNC viewer. Data may be collected in all areas using this method. This data is sent via web connection to the AWS (Amazon Web Service) cloud where data is provided in a graph. The data can be used to influence irrigation, crop choice, animal grazing, and assist land stewardship.

AB  - Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) lend themselves to a wide variety of applications in our daily lives, such as environmental monitoring, safety, health-care, animal monitoring, etc. However, one of the key issues in WSN is energy constraints. This makes energy-conservation one of the major keys to the efficient functioning and lifetime of WSN. In this paper, given a network of nodes with heterogeneous energy, our goal is to determine energy-aware disjoint dominating sets (DSs) that work as data collection nodes in each round, to improve overall WSN lifetime. In order to accomplish this goal, we propose an intelligent data collection technique with two phases, the collector nodes selection, and the data gathering path formation and collection phases. In the collector nodes selection phase, an energy-aware algorithm based on swarm intelligence is proposed to construct disjoint dominating sets that work as collector nodes in each round. In the data gathering path formation and collection phase, data gathering path is determined for achieving maximal data collection efficiency and reduced energy consumption. The efficiency of our proposed technique is proved mathematically and through simulations.

AB  - Human elephant conflict has become one of major and serious problems for many countries in Asia and Africa. The conflict between humans and elephants have resulted in loss of human life and limbs as well as death of many elephants in these countries. The main reason for the escalation of this conflict is the loss of habitat of elephants that have been traditionally used by the animals for centuries. In recent times, humans have encroached into these areas for various reasons including looking for new lands for cultivation and living. Electric fences are commonly used world over to deter elephants from coming into villages and farmlands. Though, electric fences could effectively separate the animals from people, the elephants are found to enter the villages after breaking these fences. Once the fence is broken, there is no effective security as the elephants can enter and roam freely wherever it wants. In this paper, the author presents design and prototype implementation of smart elephant detection system that can alert people when an elephant approaches human settlements. The system was tested under limited laboratory environments and found that the concept is working and can be extended after a fully-fledged field testing.

AB  - Featured Application
   The security architecture proposed can be implemented in any application that involves the use of autonomous vehicles, both terrestrial and aerial, e.g., monitoring of crops and livestock behaviour with UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles); autonomous control of implements in tractors to prepare the ground, to sow the seeds, to apply precise amounts of fertilizer or to maintain the crops; surveillance of areas with UAVs to detect intruders or wild animals; UAV-based sampling systems; etc.
   Nowadays, autonomous vehicles are incorporated into farms to facilitate manual labour. Being connected vehicles, as IoT systems, they are susceptible to cyber security attacks that try to cause damage to hardware, software or even living beings. Therefore, it is important to provide sufficient security mechanisms to protect both the communications and the data, mitigating any possible risk or harm to farmers, livestock or crops. Technology providers are aware of the importance of ensuring security, and more and more secure solutions can be found on the market today. However, generally, these particular solutions are not sufficient when they are part of complex hybrid systems, since there is no single global solution proposal. In addition, as the number of technologies and protocols used increases, the number of security threats also increases. This article presents a cyber-security architecture proposal for swarms of heterogeneous vehicles in smart farming, which covers all of the aspects recommended by the ISO 7798-2 specification in terms of security. As a result of this analysis, a detailed summary of the possible solutions and available technologies for each of the communication channels of the target system as well as some recommendations are presented.

AB  - Forestry and forest ecology research potentially lags behind related fields such as ecology, biodiversity, and conservation research in the employment of open-source software solutions, specifically the R programming language. A direct comparison of the last decade of published research literature from the top 20 ecology and forestry journals shows that R is utilized in over 30% of the literature for ecology, yet in less than 10% of the forestry literature. Open-source computing environments, such as R, Python, and Julia, increase the visibility and reproducibility of scientific research and foster collaborations through the removal of proprietary software restrictions. The lag in adoption of open-source software in forestry and forest ecology could be hindering collaboration, data sharing, and reproducibility. Here we survey the available packages in the R programming language with specific utility for forest-related research. We found more than 100 available packages which we systematically categorized by research category: community analysis; dendrochronology; forest mensuration and inventory; hydrology; informatics/IoT; modeling; phenology; and remote sensing. We present worked examples for a subgroup of R software packages for each category to demonstrate their potential and utility. In these examples we used open-source data sets of our own selection. Additionally, we collected this information into an R metapackage, ForestAnalysisInR, an R Shiny-based solution that allows users to query the R packages we have identified to find those best suited for their analysis needs in a quick and efficient way.

AB  - Nowadays, with the development of electronic devices and the internet of things (IoT), there is a growing demand for an available, eco-friendly and endless power supply. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which converts wasted mechanical energy to electricity, is an alternative to batteries for power generation. TENGs are usually fabricated from polymers, and there are already great quantities of waste polymers in the environment that concern animals, wildlife and humans. Therefore, in this work, several eco-friendly, simple and low-cost TENGs were crafted using waste polymers like polyurethane foam (PU), expanded polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene foam (PE) and melamine formaldehyde foam (MF) without performing any physical or chemical functionalization on them. Finite element analysis was performed for each TENG and simulation results supported our experimental findings. Among these TENGs, voltage and power density of 1830 V and 96.68 mW/cm(2) were achieved over a 3 x 3 cm(2) area of M-TENG. This TENG could turn on 100 commercial blue light LED. The TENG with Melamine formaldehyde foam as a tribo-positive layer (M-TENG) also showed high mechanical robustness and its output did not change after 10,000 contact and separation cycles. To examine M-TENG utilization for high voltage practical application, M-TENG was used as a power source of electrophoretic deposition. The obtained high-quality titanium dioxide coating was uniform with no microcracks.

AB  - A few years ago, hitting the silo container from the outside was the only way of knowing whether it had to be refilled with feed or water. However, current advances make it possible to develop more evolved mechanisms that not only allow the farmer to know if it is necessary to fill the silo with feed but give a precise estimate of the quantity of feed or water remaining in the silo and information on other parameters that help control the quality of the feed. To this end, it is necessary to design a device that will be placed on the inside of the silo and will detect if there is feed and how much of it by means of a sensor with ultrasonic technology. The prototype includes several motion engines which perform a complete sweep for the calculation of volume; this is important as each type of feed has a different density. In addition, the development of such a system will make it possible to optimize the delivery of feed to livestock holdings through route planning for the truck, for example, in cases where two nearby farms are short of supply.
   For this purpose, we have developed a system that incorporates an IoT device with a laser for calculating the volume of feed inside a silo. In addition, this system includes a series of sensors that can monitor temperature and humidity. Thus, the owners obtain more information from which they can draw conclusions about the conservation of the feed and about its general exploitation. Furthermore, it is possible to understand to what extent the cold and humidity affect animals and their consumption of the feed. This research work describes the evaluation of the developed prototype in several independent silos on the Hermi Group's farm (Salamanca) and outlines the obtained results.
